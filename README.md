# Keychron keyboard maps

Two maps here:

`keychron_k8_pro_mp_remix.json` is configured such that function keys operate as
Fx by default and their secondary function when modified by `fn`.

`keychron_k8_pro_mp_remix_fnlock.json` is the same as the other, but the Fx keys 
operate their secondary function (e.g. volume up/down/mute) by default and act
as Fn keys when modified by the `fn` key.
